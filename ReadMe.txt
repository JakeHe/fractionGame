PerseusAndroid: contains the Blutooth and the fraction game
ch06-mrnom: contains the game framework. you need to make it a libary in Eclipse SDK.

I used Bluetooth program posted on the http://www.pocketmagic.net/?p=1398 by Radu Motisan. It has the capability of discovering the Bluetooth devices, connecting to the device with the specified MAC address and sending the command to it. I later added the functionality of receiving data. 

I used the game framework coded in the book "Beginning Android games" by Mario Zecher., to create the faction game.
